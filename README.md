# DTSA-5502-HW

Programming Assignments for DTSA 5502. Python files are divided between the work I did and the tests that the autograder ran. Sections are divided by a line of #'s. Files are stored in master branch. Some of the tests are not included because they require packages that were pre-loaded into the online Jupyter notebook that hosted the assignments. The code still works though. Each assignment will have its own description. Files are stored in master branch.
